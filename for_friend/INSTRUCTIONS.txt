# INSTRUCTIONS for Hackathon Syariah Ingestion

Here is how to set up the "Brain" on your computer.

## 1. Setup Python
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.11).

## 2. Install Libraries
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in this folder and run:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Set API Key
Create a file named `.env` in this same folder.
Inside it, paste your Gemini API Key like this:
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYourKeyHere...

## 4. Run the Ingestion
Run the script to read all the PDFs in the `data_bnm` folder:
   python ingest.py

## 5. Wait
It will take some time because it sleeps between files to be nice to the free API.
Once it's done, you will see a `chroma_db` folder appear. That is the brain!

## Note
If you see a "Rate Limit" error, don't worry! The script is smart—it will wait 60 seconds and try again automatically.
